# 🧠 AI Skin Infection Detector

An AI-driven skin disease detection platform that leverages convolutional neural networks and transfer learning to classify 10 distinct skin diseases from images. The system processes user-uploaded images and returns diagnosis probabilities, dietary recommendations, and suggested supplements to support skin care, all through a web-based interface.

- Trained on a custom dataset with balanced classes
- Uses transfer learning (EfficientNet/ResNet) for high accuracy
- Recommends supplements based on disease diagnosis
- Web-friendly interface for image uploads and results
- Includes user safety disclaimer and ethical data handling

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Flask or FastAPI
- **Frontend:** React or Streamlit (optional)
- **Model:** CNN (e.g., EfficientNet, MobileNet)
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, GitHub Actions, VS Code

- ## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Skin Infection Detector application locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**: For the backend AI analysis.
